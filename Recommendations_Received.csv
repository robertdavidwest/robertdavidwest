Gary,Lombardo,Signify Health,"Senior Director, Product Management, Data Products",Rob and I have worked together in different capacities over the last 5+ years. He is the master of 'getting it done'. He takes pride in the things he does and he tends to do them very well. Rob was instrumental in helping Signify Health achieve over $1B in shared savings over the course of the BPCI and BPCI-A program by leading the team that was responsible for end to end data delivery.   He has turned into a great engineering leader and will certainly make a positive impact wherever he goes. I hope to work together again soon!,"12/09/22, 07:18 PM",VISIBLE
Anton,Fritsch,Atlas Health,Vice President of Engineering,"I met Robert upon joining Signify Health where he would become a manager under my supervision. Immediately one could tell that he had a great understanding of his team's culture and had an ever-present finger on its pulse. His ability to inspire his team and keep group discourse positive and energetic is something of which I'm envious. He cares deeply for his colleagues and has always been vigilant of areas where he could help others grow their careers and skills. His team was in a transitional phase into an R&D focus and with a little bit of strategic input, Robert not only ran with it but was a driving force in the DevOps transformation of his team. He's shown a strong ability for blocking and tackling for his team, while building bridges with stakeholders and growing lasting cross-functional partnerships that promote ownership and understanding between involved parties.  I would gladly work with him again, I believe his trajectory in technical leadership will prove him capable in a multitude of environments.","10/20/22, 03:45 PM",VISIBLE

Robert has been a great manager, teacher, role model, and friend to me and others. I have learned a lot from him about being a professional developer and couldn't have asked for a better mentor to start my career. His energy and determination combined with his compassion made him an invaluable part of the team as a decision-maker in meetings and an engineer collaborating with me and other developers. He is a fit for any role in a company because of all his skills, experience, and personality.","09/29/22, 01:39 PM",VISIBLE
