### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and Data Engineer. 

I've spent a great deal of my career working on enterprise level data pipelines and providing Data Engineering support and Leadership to Data Warehouse and Analytics organizations. 

Iâ€™m a Solutions Engineer, a problem solver and a builder. I love to code, I love to mentor and teach. I love to design systems and
projects. Most recently I'm working to improve my web development skills.
