### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Robert. I'm a Full Stack Software Engineer and Data Engineer. I've spent a great deal of my career working on enterprize level data pipelines and providing Data Engineering support to the Data Warehouse and Analytics organizations. Mostly recently I'm working to improve my web development skills. 

Iâ€™m a Solutions Engineer, a problem solver and a builder. I love to code, I love to mentor and teach. I love to design systems and
projects. I have applied my skills across software engineering, analytics, data engineering, strategic planning, stakeholder
relations, staff coaching and team development. I have proven success in finding simple solutions to complex data-centric
problems to foster lasting prosperity.
